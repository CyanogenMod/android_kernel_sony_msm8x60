* MSM PM-8x60

PM-8x60 is the low power management device for MSM (Snapdragon class) chipsets.
This device sets up different components to do low power modes and registers with
the kernel to be notified of idle and suspend states and when called, follows
through the set of instructions in putting the application cores to the lowest
power mode possible.

The required properties for PM-8x60 are:

- compatible: "qcom,pm-8x60"

The optional properties are:

- qcom,use-sync-timer: Indicates whether the target uses the synchronized QTimer.
- qcom,pc-mode: Indicates the type of power collapse used by the target. The
           valid values for this are:
	0  (Power collapse terminates in TZ; integrated L2 cache controller)
	1, (Power collapse doesn't terminate in TZ; external L2 cache controller)
	2  (Power collapse terminates in TZ; external L2 cache controller)

Example:

qcom,pm-8x60 {
		compatible = "qcom,pm-8x60";
		qcom,pc-mode = <0>;
		qcom,use-sync-timer;
	};
